# Simple Search Engine

In this project I made a search engine using a linked list in C. In this example, I'll create a linked list to store some strings, and then allow the user to search for a string within that list.

// what we need.
### <stdlib.h> library to use malloc() function to allocate memory dynamically.
### <string.h> to use string functions.
// what we need.
